You hear the sound of a door creaking in the wind, and cautiously make your way inside. As you explore the main floor, you discover a broken conveyor belt that leads to an old, dusty assembly line. The machinery seems to have been untouched for years. You continue to explore the factory, searching for any signs of life or activity.",

You push the door open and step inside, revealing a room full of old toys, dolls, and teddy bears. You notice that some of the toys seem to be moving slightly, almost as if they're alive. You investigate the room further, and soon realize that the toys are indeed alive, and are plotting something sinister.",

It's a contraption made of brass and gears, with a large lever on the side. You're not sure what it does, but you feel compelled to pull the lever and see what happens. Suddenly, the entire room begins to shake and rattle, and you realize that you've activated some kind of machinery. You have to quickly find a way to shut it down before it's too late.",
